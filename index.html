    <!--1. Identify the different elements, classes, and IDs within the HTML document.-->
    <h1 align="center">Analyzing and Applying CSS Selectors</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Question 1</h2>
    <p>In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), elements, classes, and IDs are used to structure and style content on a web page. Here's a brief overview of each:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Elements:</li>
        <p>Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents.
            They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For example:</p>
          <p> open_tag This is a paragraph. Closing_tag</p>
        
        <li>Classes:</li>
        <p>Classes are used to group multiple HTML elements together so that they can be styled using CSS or targeted by JavaScript.
            The class attribute is added to an HTML element, and its value is the class name. Multiple classes can be assigned to a single element, separated by spaces.</p>
        <li>IDs:</li>
        <p>IDs are similar to classes but are intended to uniquely identify a specific element on a page.
            The id attribute is added to an HTML element, and its value is the unique ID name. Unlike classes, each ID should be unique within a document.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, elements define the structure and content, classes group elements for styling, and IDs provide a unique identifier for a specific element. It's important to use classes for multiple elements that share styles and IDs for unique identification. CSS and JavaScript can then reference these classes and IDs to apply styles or manipulate the content dynamically.</p>

    <!--2. Determine the appropriate CSS selectors that can be used to style specific elements, classes,   
     or IDs.-->
     <h2 align="center">Question 2</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) selectors are used to target and style specific elements, classes, or IDs in an HTML document. Here are examples of common CSS selectors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Element Selector:</li>
        <p>Selects all instances of a specific HTML element.
        </p>
        <li>Class Selector:</li>
        <p>Selects all elements with a specific class.</p>
        <li>ID Selector:</li>
        <p>Selects the element with a specific ID.</p>
        <li>Attribute Selector:</li>
        <p>Selects elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>These are just a few examples, and there are many more advanced selectors and combinations you can use to target specific elements or groups of elements on a webpage. The choice of selector depends on your specific styling requirements and the structure of your HTML document.</p>

    <h2 align="center">Question 3</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) selectors play a crucial role in styling web documents, allowing developers to target specific HTML elements, classes, and IDs to apply stylistic changes. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the usage of CSS selectors based on identified elements, classes, and IDs.</p>
        <li>Elements</li>
        <p>Element selectors are the most fundamental selectors in CSS, enabling the styling of specific HTML elements.</p>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <p class="red-text">Class selectors are used to group multiple elements together, providing a way to apply common styles to related content
        This class selector targets all elements with the class "red-text," allowing for the consistent application of red text across different HTML elements.
        </p>
        <li>IDs</li>
        <p id="header">ID selectors are employed to uniquely identify a specific HTML element, enabling precise styling for individual elementsThis ID selector targets a specific element with the ID "header," allowing for distinct styling that is unique to that particular element.</p>
        <li>Combining Selectors</li>
        <p>CSS selectors can be combined to create more specific and targeted styles. For example, the descendant selector allows styling of nested elements:</p>
    </ol>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>In conclusion, CSS selectors are powerful tools for web developers to precisely target and style elements within HTML documents. Whether styling by element type, class, or ID, and combining selectors for more specificity, CSS provides a flexible and effective way to control the presentation of web content.

    Understanding the diverse range of CSS selectors and their applications empowers developers to create visually appealing and well-organized web pages, contributing to a positive user experience.
